#BirdWatch  

This is a dynamic web application for visualizing a constant stream of live Tweets as they occur. I call it BirdWatch. In the current version it generates a dynamic word cloud and a bar chart of the most frequent words within the last 1,000 Tweets. This web application is based on **[Play 2.1](http://www.playframework.com)**. I have written it for learning the concept of **[Iteratees](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0.4/Iteratees)** in combination with consuming the **[Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis)** and updating a single page web app using **[Server Sent Events](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/)**. The visualization is done through the **[D3.js](http://d3js.org)** data visualization library. Tweets are persisted using **[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org)** and **[ReactiveMongo](http://reactivemongo.org)**, the reactive Scala driver for MongoDB. Large user profile images are downloaded from Twitter for each request and converted down to 80 * 80 pixels. This was done mostly to try out distributing such a task using actors and a round robin router. Also the Twitter thumbnails were a little too small with 48 * 48 pixels. 

You can **[try BirdWatch](http://birdwatch.matthiasnehlsen.com)** without having to install anything. **[Check out my Blog](http://matthiasnehlsen.com)** for additional documentation and follow **[@_MNehlsen](https://twitter.com/_MNehlsen)** for updates on this project.

The idea behind this reactive web app is to explore processing a live stream of information using Scala and the Play Framework (making use of Akka actors). A rolling window of Tweets is analyzed in terms of certain parameters and displayed graphically. The **[d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud)** project by Jason Davies is used for displaying the word cloud, adapted for dynamic updates as new data comes in as **[Server Sent Events](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/)**. Tweets are also stored within MongoDB. Storing the Tweets in a persistent data store allows pre-loading the 500 most recent Tweets when the page is loaded and will allow further analysis in the future.

###Setup

Twitter API consumer key and access token are required to consume the **[Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis)**. You need to **[create a Twitter application](https://dev.twitter.com/apps)** and store keys and secrets in a twitter.conf file, using the commented out section in the **[application.conf](https://github.com/matthiasn/BirdWatch/blob/master/conf/application.conf)** as a template. Please feel free to **[contact me](mailto:matthias.nehlsen@gmail.com)** if there are problems getting the application up and running. 

###Streaming API limitations 
Please be aware that only one connection to the Twitter Streaming API is possible from any one public IP address. Starting a connection to the Streaming API will potentially end other connections from the same network if **[NAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)** is in place using the same public IP address. Access from mobile networks is discouraged for the same reason.
